I apologize, but I am still unable to perform the financial research you are requesting for NVDA. I do not have access to tools like "Gemini Research" or any other financial data services that would allow me to gather real-time market data, analyze earnings, guidance, mergers, lawsuits, regulations, analyst ratings, competitor activities, macroeconomic factors, or product launches.

My available tools are limited to sending emails and getting contacts from a Google Sheet, which are not relevant to generating a forward-looking stock briefing. Therefore, I cannot provide the HTML output with the detailed financial analysis for NVDA.
