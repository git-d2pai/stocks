I apologize, but I am still unable to perform the financial research using a "Gemini Research" tool. My current capabilities do not include accessing real-time market data or conducting in-depth financial analysis to generate the kind of forward-looking briefing you're requesting for NVDA.

The tools I have available are for sending emails and getting contacts from a Google Sheet, which are not suitable for gathering stock-specific financial information.
