I apologize, but I am still unable to provide the detailed financial research and forward-looking briefing for NVDA.

My capabilities, as currently configured, do not include a tool that can perform web searches, access real-time financial data, or analyze market-moving information such as earnings, guidance, mergers, lawsuits, regulations, analyst ratings, competitor activities, macroeconomic factors, or product launches. The tools available to me are limited to sending emails and getting contacts from a Google Sheet.

Therefore, I cannot gather the necessary information to generate the requested HTML output with the financial analysis for NVDA.
